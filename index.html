    <!-- To add a image in the webpage we can use img tag and and here src means source where we put the url and the alt attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which is mandatory and incredibly useful for accessibility — screen readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or link rot. -->
    <!-- Without putting the url from internet we can also add the image to the html file and then we can just put the name of the file into the src -->
    <!-- If we have create a folder named images then we can put the image in that folder and then we can use the path of the image in the src attribute of the img tag and we can use the path like this images/Ganeshji.jpg -->
